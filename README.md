# Team Profile Generator

A command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

## How this generator works

The user is presented with a series of prompts in relation to their employee details and details about their team members. Once the user has answered all prompts, including options to add different employee types, the team details entered by the user are populated into the 'output.html' file in the 'output folder'. The user will be able to restart the application to generate a new team page. This will overwrite the previous page generated.

## Installation

To start the application, please complete the following steps:

1. Open the repo in the local environment.
2. Install Inquirer v8.2.4 by entering 'npm i inquirer@8.2.4' in the command line.
3. Open 'index.js' in the integrated terminal. 
4. Enter 'node index.js' in the command line and follow the prompts.
5. Navigate to the output.html file in the 'output' folder.

## Tests

To run the tests written for each of the parent and child classes (employee class and employee type subclasses), enter "npm test" from the integrated terminal.
